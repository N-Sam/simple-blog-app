# simple-blog-app
This is a simple personal blog site I built while learning Django!, it can be scaled up into a better blog by adding a few functionalities
I created this using mysql, any one who is interested in this project may use the same by creating a database in mysql admin page and run the migartion
If you can`t change the db configuration then name your db "django_project" without the quote! and run the migration.
Create a new super user using "python manage.py createsuperuser --username yourname --email your email", remember to type this command without the quotes, then you will be prompted to enter a password,
good luck!
